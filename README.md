Simple Hollow Logs is a server-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mod that attempts to add the hollow logs from the Minecraft Live 2021 Birch Forest concept art!

Read on to find out how to download this mod, and what opportunities doing so will provide you with!

## Getting Started
Due to the use of `FlammableBlockRegistry`, `FabricItemSettings`, `ItemGroupEvents`, `BiomeModifications` and `BiomeSelectors`, you will need to download [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) in order to use this mod. Once you have, simply place both the Fabric API and Simple Hollow Logs in your mods folder.

## Details
Currently, this mod features hollow log variants of every vanilla log type. Logs from other mods may be supported in the future.

Hollow logs are located to the right of their solid counterparts in the creative inventory. In survival mode, you can craft 8 regular logs into a donut shape (similar to the chest recipe) to get 8 hollow logs of this variant in return. You can also find hollow logs generating naturally in some forest-y biomes across the overworld!

Hollow logs can be stripped and waterlogged, and have a collision box just the right size to crawl inside with a trapdoor, as shown.
